# TASK 4 MAIN REQUIREMENT: Function play(state, agentA, agentB)
# Implements the core gameplay loop for the Hinger game
# Allows two agents (or one agent and a human player) to take turns making moves
#
# REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY (from specification):
# • Alternate turns between agentA and agentB
# • Detect when game is over: win (hinger) or draw (all counters removed)
# • Return winner name or None for draw
# • Detect and handle illegal moves
# • agentA=None or agentB=None indicates human player
#
# BONUS FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (optional Task 4.b):
# • Time-limited game (60 seconds per move by default)
# • Track total time used by each player
# • Count and display number of moves made
# • Save move history to file for analysis/replay
